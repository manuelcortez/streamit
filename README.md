# streamit

A simple, self hosted alternative to Netflix (made in Web2py).

Streamit is an application I made in a few weeks, mainly because in certain countries is not illegal to own a private collection of audio and video files you purchased, just for personal use. This application works in any operating system including a webbrowser, and also there is a Kodi addon being developed to use its API. Here is the list of features already working in streamit:

* Search and add automatically new Movies, TV Shows and seasons for TV shows, in English, Spanish or russian. When adding a movie, TV Show or Season, Streamit will retrieve useful information such as title, release date, staff, description and more, from [The movie database.](https://www.themoviedb.org)
* Add local files to movies or TV episodes, so you can play them from a web interface.
* Track your position in the video, so next time you will play the episode it will resume where it was, instead of starting from the beginning.
* Should work in firefox, Google chrome, Internet explorer 11, Microsoft Edge and Kodi.
